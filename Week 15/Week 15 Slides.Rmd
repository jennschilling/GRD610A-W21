# Things to Remember

- "Visualization is not meant just to be *seen*...but to be *read*"

.bottom-note[
(Cairo, 2016, p. 333)
]

--

- We can help our audience read a visualization by adding explanations

--

- Don't be afraid to use novel charts (and don't assume your audience will not understand them)

--

- Re-design and constructive critiques should be part of the data visualization design process

--

- There are many opportunities and topics for data visualization

---
# Discussion

- What are your top takeaways from this chapter?

--

- Which visualizations stood out to you? Why?

--

- What questions do you have?

# Final Project

**Task: ** Using R and an approved dataset, create a polished infographic that contains at least 5 different charts.  

**Due: ** May 5, 2021

[Rubric](https://bb.collegeforcreativestudies.edu/webapps/rubric/do/course/manageRubrics?dispatch=view&context=course&rubricId=_42757_1&course_id=_35307_1)

- Pick a dataset using one of the resources available on Blackboard. The dataset must be approved; email Jenn a link to the dataset for approval prior to **March 31**.  

- Create summary statistics and 5-7 polished visuals based on the dataset using **only R**. 

- The visuals created in R must include: titles, axis labels, data labels and legends (as needed), your name and the data source (as footnotes/captions)  

- Output the visuals to `.svg` and import them into Adobe Illustrator to create an infographic that includes a narrative, the visuals from R, and other graphics.  

- Turn in your R code as an `.Rmd` file (including comments about what you did and why), your data file, and the final infographic. 

- In class on **April 28**, be prepared to share information about your dataset, your visuals, what they show, and the choices you made in their design. You will share both your code and the final infographic.

???

In class on April 28, we will be sharing critiques of each others work. 

Presentation to the class: share your .Rmd file and be prepared to explain your data (what is it about, what does it tell you, what messages did you find in it), your visualizations (how did you create them, why did you create them, what design choices you made); share your infographic (what design choices did you make and why, what story or message does the infographic show)
