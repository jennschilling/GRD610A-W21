# Discussion

The Five Qualities of Great Visualizations:
1. Truthful  
2. Functional  
3. Beautiful  
4. Insightful  
5. Enlightening  

From p. 45 of Cairo, A. (2016). *The truthful art: Data, charts, and maps for communication.* New Riders.

```{r break-countdown, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 15, seconds = 0,
          right = "37%",

# A Reminder of The ``ggplot`` Process

1. Tell the ``ggplot()`` function what our data is. (``data = ... ``)

2. Tell ``ggplot()`` what relationships we want to see.For convenience we will put the results of the first two steps in an object called ``p``.  (``mapping = aes(...)``)

3. Tell ``ggplot`` how we want to see the relationships in our data.  (``geom_...``)

4. Layer on geoms as needed, by adding them to the ``p`` object one at a time.  

5. Use some additional functions to adjust scales, labels, tick marks, titles. Weâ€™ll learn more about some of these functions shortly.

# Homework Assignment

**Task: ** Create 3 different types of charts.  

**Due: ** February 17, 2020 

[Rubric](https://bb.collegeforcreativestudies.edu/webapps/rubric/do/course/manageRubrics?dispatch=view&context=course&rubricId=_42755_1&course_id=_35307_1)

**Notes**

- You should explore a dataset other than the *gapminder* one we've been using in the labs (some ideas: *babynames*, *palmerpenguins*, a CSV file you found)  

- To use an R package dataset, remember to run *install.packages("package_name")* once in the console and add *library(package_name)* to the *setup* portion of the .Rmd file

- See Blackboard assignment for a template .Rmd file
