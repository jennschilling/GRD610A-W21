**GRD610A: Data Visualization II | Winter 2021**

**Data Visualization of the Week**

Each week a member of the class will share a data visualization at the start of the class session. This visualization can be an example of an effective or ineffective visualization. It should be related to your interests, passions, or career interests and related to the current or prior weekâ€™s course content. Think about how you might make the visualization in R.

The presenter will:
- share an image of the data visualization  
- briefly explain what the visualization shows  
- explain what makes the visualization effective or ineffective  
- explain how the visualization relates to the current or prior weeks' course content  
- discuss how the visualization might be made in R (this part of the presentation will expand as we move through the course and learn more about R)
