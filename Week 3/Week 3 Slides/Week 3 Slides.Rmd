# Revisit Padlet

[Data Visualization II Padlet](https://padlet.com/jschilling_ccs/mmzv9zg2ic8e6iqs)

#### What should we add?  

#### What new information have we gained this week? 

---

# Discussion

“A good visualization is:  
1. reliable information,  
2. visually encoded so relevant patterns become noticeable,  
3. organized in a way that enables at least some exploration, when it’s appropriate,  
4. and presented in an attractive manner, but always remembering that honesty, clarity, and depth come first.”  

From p. 12 of Cairo, A. (2016). *The truthful art: Data, charts, and maps for communication.* New Riders.

### Do you agree? Should anything be added?

# Discussion


**Candid communication:** "begin with the information and then...thoroughly analyze it to discover the messages worth spreading" (2016, Ciaro, *The Truthful Art*, p. 15)  


What do you think of the elements of journalism (p. 21)?  

--

How do these elements relate to this class?   

---

# Discussion

How do you define **data visualization** versus **infographic**?

--

What aspects of the data visualizations and infographics presented in Chapter 1 of *The Truthful Art* stood out to you?

--

**Some Interactive Examples**

# Wide Data

```{r wide-table, echo = FALSE}

head(gapminder %>%
       select(country, year, lifeExp) %>%
       pivot_wider(names_from = year,
                   values_from = lifeExp)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html")

```

---

# Long Data 

```{r long-table, echo = FALSE}

head(gapminder %>%
       select(country, year, lifeExp)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html")

```


---

# Tidy Data 

```{r tidy-table, echo = FALSE}

head(gapminder) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")

```

# Mapping Data

.pull-left[
```{r no-mapping, fig.show = 'hide'}
  p <- ggplot(data = gapminder)

  p #<<
  
```

ggplot knows the data, but not how to map it.

]
.pull-right[
```{r plot-no-mapping, ref.label = 'no-mapping', echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

# Mapping Data
.pull-left[
```{r mapping-added, fig.show = 'hide'}
  p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
              mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, #<<
                            y = lifeExp)) #<<

  p 
  
```

- ``aes()`` links variables to parts of the plot
 
- ggplot knows the data and how  to map it  
 
- BUT we have not provided information about what to draw

]
.pull-right[
```{r plot-mapping-added, ref.label = 'mapping-added', echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

# Drawing Data
.pull-left[
```{r geom-added, fig.show = 'hide'}
  p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
              mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                            y = lifeExp)) 

  p + geom_point() #<<
  
```

Now ggplot knows the data, how to map it, and how to draw the plot (``geom_point()``)

]
.pull-right[
```{r plot-geom-added, ref.label = 'geom-added', echo = FALSE}
```
]

# The ``ggplot`` Process

1. Tell the ``ggplot()`` function what our data is. (``data = ... ``)

2. Tell ``ggplot()`` what relationships we want to see.For convenience we will put the results of the first two steps in an object called ``p``.  (``mapping = aes(...)``)

3. Tell ``ggplot`` how we want to see the relationships in our data.  (``geom_...``)

4. Layer on geoms as needed, by adding them to the ``p`` object one at a time.  

5. Use some additional functions to adjust scales, labels, tick marks, titles. We’ll learn more about some of these functions shortly.
