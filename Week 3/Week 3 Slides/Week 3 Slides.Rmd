# Discussion

“A good visualization is:  
1. reliable information,  
2. visually encoded so relevant patterns become noticeable,  
3. organized in a way that enables at least some exploration, when it’s appropriate,  
4. and presented in an attractive manner, but always remembering that honesty, clarity, and depth come first.”  

Alberto Cairo, *The Truthful Art*, p. 12

# Tidy Data

In tidy data:  
1. Each variable forms a column.  
2. Each observation forms a row.  
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.  

From Wickham, H. (2014). Tidy Data. *Journal of Statistical Software*, 59(10).
